# hand_gesture_game_control

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and Mediapipe, enabling users to control the popular game Subway Surfers through intuitive hand movements. The system captures real-time video input from a webcam, processes hand landmarks to recognize gestures, and translates these gestures into keyboard commands for the game.

# Features
